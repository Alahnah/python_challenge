The beginning of my code I had help from a tutor his name was Kout Bailey we opened my files and went over the first two questions.

This code was used to help create my average rate of change:

(1960, June 1). Average annual change?. Stack Overflow. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19483132/average-annual-change 

This was used to help create a text file in my code for both projects:
Campbell, S. (2023, May 13). How to create (write) text file in python. Guru99. https://www.guru99.com/reading-and-writing-files-in-python.html

This was used to help count the unique values in my for loop:
